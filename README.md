1501 Term Assignment

This was a semester long project for 1501 (Intro. to Game Design) which I worked on with two classmates. The project was written in the Processing environment (essentially a library for Java with some interesting changes from a typical library). Processing is available here: https://www.processing.org/

The game is a very simple top-down shooter with some basic trading mechanics built in. You start as a single ship and travel from planet to planet buying and selling goods. On the way to each planet you will encounter increasing amounts of resistance and will have to fight to proceed.

On this project I did much of the work on collision detection and AI, which I wrote from scratch and had no previous experience working with.  As such, they are quite rudimentary and probably not particularly efficient, but they worked the way I wanted them to and I'm quite pleased with how they turned out.
